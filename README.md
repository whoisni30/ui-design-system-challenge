# 🎨 ui-design-system-challenge – Nitish Kumar

A scalable, enterprise-grade **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** design system built as part of a **Front-End Development Internship Assignment**.

This project demonstrates strong UI engineering fundamentals: **color theming**, **accessibility**, **component reusability**, and thorough **Storybook documentation**.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project was developed to meet the specific requirements outlined in the assignment brief, focusing on:

- A **token-based color system** for light and dark themes
- Fully responsive and accessible UI components
- Detailed component documentation using **Storybook**
- Scalable project structure using **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **React**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Design and implement a robust, token-based color system  
✅ Build **2 enterprise-grade components**:  
  1. **Multi-Step Wizard Form**  
  2. **Advanced Modal System**  
✅ Apply proper state management, interaction logic, and accessibility
